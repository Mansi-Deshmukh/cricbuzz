            <h6>
                The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to send KL Rahul abroad for treatment, and it is likely that the India opener and vice-captain will have treatment in Germany. The 30-year-old is down with a recurring groin injury and is set to miss the trip to England, where India plays seven games.

Rahul going abroad has been confirmed to Cricbuzz by the BCCI. "That is correct, the board is working on his fitness and he will be going to Germany soon," BCCI secretary Jay Shah told Cricbuzz on Thursday (June 16). Rahul is likely to fly out to Germany by the end of this month or early July.

The obvious implication of the overseas treatment is Rahul will miss the England tour, where India are to play one Test (from July 1 to 5) and six white ball games - three Twenty20 Internationals and as many ODIs. He was named vice-captain under Rohit Sharma for the tour but the India selectors will have to name another deputy.
On Thursday morning, one batch of the Indian team consisting of the players for the July 1-5 Test in Edgbaston, left for England from Mumbai and understandably Rahul was not one of them. As previously reported by Cricbuzz there was no plan to announce a replacement, unless of course there was a request from the team management. In that case, Mayank Agarwal would have been named to the squad. The selectors, however, will have to announce a vice-captain for the tour as the chances of Rahul taking part in any of the seven games are virtually ruled out. After the Edgbaston Test, India's white ball engagements span from July 7 and 17 with T20Is preceding the ODI series.

The Karnataka and Lucknow Super Giants cricketer, who has played in 43 Tests, 42 ODIs and 56 T20Is, has not played international cricket since February this year. He, however, managed to survive the wear and tear of the IPL.

Cricbuzz reached out to the player and a formal response is awaited.
